% Abstract 
\begin{abstract}
The HPC Carpentry project aims to develop highly interactive workshop training materials to empower HPC novices to effectively solve scientific and technical problems in their domains. Modeled after the Carpentries training programs, the workshop aims to develop foundational HPC skills and a sense of self efficacy, rather than expertise. The workshop setting provides learners with hands-on experience that elicits confidence working with HPC systems and provides sufficient vocabulary to make subsequent self-study more effective.

The project is the product of significant work over the past several years, incorporating valuable material from many contributors.

Our most recent focus has been developing workshop materials for HPC users. We begin with an introduction to the command-line shell using Software Carpentryâ€™s Shell lesson and progress to our introductory HPC lesson covering remote access and resource management. We end with a newly developed lesson on HPC workflow management, which walks learners through the specification and execution of a scaling study on an HPC system, emphasizing both the benefits and limitations of HPC systems for domain applications. This workshop program was recently run in full at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

Next, the project will develop training resources for HPC developers, which will give workshop instructors the option of replacing the workflow lesson with a coding exercise in a parallel framework, such as MPI.

In a major milestone, the steering committee is leading the project through the formal incubation process towards becoming an official Carpentries lesson program alongside the existing Software, Data, and Library Carpentry programs.
